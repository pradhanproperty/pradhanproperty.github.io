        For a human, there are seven intelligences. Each intelligence is of similar importance in reaching our full
        potential.
        1 : Linguistic intelligence : The ability to write or talk well. Some individuals just resemble to possess the
        "gift of gab".Or they can write well. Many individuals like to read favorable novels, or even write poetry. They
        possess favorable linguistic intelligence.

        2 : Mathematical/Logical intelligence : The ability to deal well with numbers and to suspect logically. You
        probably know individuals who perform not suspect of themselves as “intelligent,” but who are razor-sharp in
        adding up the odds on a bet or at calculating statistics for foot- ball or baseball! Engineers, scientists and
        accountants would demonstrate this intelligence.

        3 : Visual/Spatial intelligence : The ability to visualize how things will eventually look. To imagine things in
        your mind’s eye. Designers, architects and artists would be an example, but you use it when you use your sense
        of direction, navigate or draw well.

        4 : Musical intelligence : The ability to create and interpret music. To retain rhythm. Most of us possess a
        favorable basic musical intelligence, and we can all develop it. Think how helpful it is to learn with a jingle
        or rhyme (e.g. “30 days hath September”).

        5 : Bodily/Physical intelligence : You use this intelligence when you progress well, run, dance, build and
        construct something. All arts and crafts use this intelligence. Many individuals who are physically talented and
        “good with their hands” not recognize that they are showing a high form of intelligence. One that is of equal
        value to the other intelligences.

        6 : Inter-Personal intelligence : The ability to communicate well and obtain along with others. Many people
        possess a superb ability to generate individuals feel at ease, to read others’ reactions and to be sympathetic
        to the feelings of others. This is a vital human intelligence. This talent is used to the full in being a
        favorable parent, a supportive colleague or a favorable teacher.

        7 : Intra-Personal Intelligence : An ability for quiet, objective self-analysis. This leads to being able to
        understand your own behavior and feelings. You use this intelligence to create your own goals and plans, and to
        study your own successes and mistakes as a guide to future improvement.

        It is worth spending a few minutes looking at this list of seven intelligences or talents again. Be aware that
        they are of equal value. This modern way of looking at people’s ability has led Dr. Howard Gardner to propose a
        modern definition of “intelligence.” It is “the ability to create useful products and solve everyday problems.”
        Previously, intelligence was defined much more narrowly. It was mostly related to academic performance. Yet
        academic subjects are largely taught through just two intelligences – the linguistic and mathematical/logical
        intelligences. Academic success is indeed one way of demonstrating intelligence. In the real world, however, it
        is far from the only way.

        The six stages of learning
        We believe that effective learning should involve six stages:
        1 : State of mind :Your need to be in a “ re s o u rc e f u l” state of mind. That state of mind is relaxed,
        confident and motivated. If you are stressed, or lack belief in your a b i l i t y, or cannot realize the point
        of what you are learning, you won’t learn well.

        2 : Intake of information : You need to take in the facts to suit your learning preferences. There are
        differences in the extent to which we each need to see, hear or to get physically involved in what we are
        learning. When you initial start to read, listen to or watch something new, you need to do something to generate
        that information more memorable to yourself. What you perform depends on your preference for visual, auditory or
        physical learning – or whether a deliberate combination of all three works finest for you.

        3 : Explore the subject : You need to explore what you are learning. There’s a difference between knowing about
        something and truly understanding it. When you thoroughly explore a subject, you turn surface knowledge into
        deep understanding. How you achieve this depends upon other important learning preferences – preferences that
        depend upon the unique way you use your range of intelligences.

        4 : Memorize the information : You need to memorize the key elements of what you possess learned. The aim is to
        commit one or two key facts to memory so the rest of what you’ve learned comes flooding back.

        5 : Show you know : Unless you test your understanding of what you’ve learned, you cannot be sure you really
        understood it. You need to “show you know.”

        6 : Reflect on how you learn : You need to reflect on how well the learning went. The aim is to improve not just
        what you know, but how you learn. That way you will become a better and better learner.

        The first surprise is that you actually have three
        brains. Each one evolved after the other.

        At the base of your skull you have a rather primitive
        brain. It keeps you breathing and it keeps your heart
        beating. It tells you to fight or run when danger
        threatens. It also controls some of your more primitive
        instincts, like your sense of territory. Which is why
        you start feeling angry or uncomfortable when
        someone moves too close to you.

        Next to evolve was your middle brain, a type of
        brain that mammals also possess. Only recently
        have we realized how important this mid-brain is to
        learning.
        Your middle brain controls your hormonal system, your health
        (immune system), your sexuality, your emotions and an important part
        of your long-term memory. The fact that our emotions and our long-term
        memory are both controlled from this same middle brain explains something
        we have all observed.
        When something involves strong emotions, it is usually very well remembered.
        You probably remember your first kiss, for example, or where you were when
        you heard someone significant had died. It also means enjoyment and fun are
        important elements in learning, because they involve positive emotions.
        Make a fist with your hand. Now wrap your other
        hand over the top of this fist. If your wrist repre-
        sents your primitive brain, and the fist is your
        middle brain, the hand wrapped over it represents
        your new brain.
        The incredible capacity of the brain has only recently been realized. You have
        about 100 billion brain cells, a number that is almost impossible to visualize.
        It is 20 times the entire population of the world.
        A brain cell looks a bit like a miniature octopus. The cell is in the middle.
        Branching out from it are tiny threads. Each time something reaches one of
        your senses (sight, sound or touch), it creates a thought or impression that
        travels out from a brain cell and along one of the little branch-like threads.

        Stress, however, is not only the worry and concerns of which you are
        conscious. Very often people with a poor previous experience of learning feel
        unconsciously threatened by new learning experiences.
        Dr. Benjamin Bloom has spent a
        lifetime studying excellence.
        It becomes a vicious circle. Because they feel they are poor at learning, they
        feel threatened. And because they feel under threat, their thinking brain
        receives less information, so they do learn less effectively. His conclusion is that anyone
        can learn anything – the only
        difference is that some take
        more time than others.
        If you feel insecure, less of your brain’s potential is available. That is why,
        when you are worried, you may suddenly come to realize that you had been
        staring at a page, without taking anything in.
